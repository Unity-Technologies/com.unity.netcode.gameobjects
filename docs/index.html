            <p class="lead">The MLAPI is a high level networking library built for the Unity
                game engine to abstract networking concept. This allows developers to focus
                on the game rather than low level protocols and networking frameworks. All this
                is provided <strong>for free</strong> under the permissive <strong>MIT Licence</strong>
                by the MLAPI collaborators. The MLAPI is <strong>open source</strong> with
                <strong>no attached costs or limitations</strong>.

            <h2 class="header-light regular-pad">Why the MLAPI?</h2>

            <p>The MLAPI is one of the oldest and most actively developed game networking
                library out there. As a direct result of this, it offers many more features than other libraries.
                A comparison between other libraries can be seen on the <a href="{{ "/features/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">features</a>
                page. But in short, the MLAPI's focus is to make networking simple to let you focus on what matters for
                your game.
